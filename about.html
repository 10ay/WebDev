            <p id="first-line">I am Weird</p>
            <p>When I find my favorite black chair, I do not just sit on it. Instead, I use the uncertainty principle to argue whether the chair really exists or if its position and condition are as uncertain as the life of Schrodinger’s cat. Similarly, when I look up at the sky, I do not just look at the stars, but use the laws of physics to wonder what lies between the stars. But why? To understand that, you have to trace the journey back to when I first heard the rhyme ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star; How I Wonder What You Are?’. While the rhyme frustratingly never answered what the ‘little star’ actually was, I understood how everything in the universe has a ‘secret’ story to tell, and the laws of physics are the tools to decipher that story. And that is why I love physics – it turns me into a storyteller. 
            </p>
            <p>Born in a family of entrepreneurial wizards and computer warlocks, my arguments about how a simple ballpoint pen demonstrated exceptional use of the laws of gravity and friction were seldom understood. Nonetheless, nothing has ever deterred me from using physics to unravel the story behind even the most diminutive incidences in my life. This is exactly why I’ve spent hours observing the centrifugal force help expel water molecules radially outwards on my clothes in a washing machine or appreciating how the air column inside my water bottle reveals that pitch is inversely proportional to the length of the vibrating air column. After all, it is a storyteller’s duty to observe and translate reality by using a particular language. And the language I’m keen on understanding and using is the language of physics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This language has its own perks. Once, drowned in the essence of this language, I found myself ogling at my laptop screen at 3 in the morning; ten weeks of work had coalesced to create a design for a machine that could use the force of gravity to generate electricity. In a country like India, a project such as this could assuage the needs of thousands of households deprived of basic electricity. Using my powers of observation to identify problems within my community and tapping my creativity to find solutions to these problems is what stimulates me. With my design for the gravity-based electricity generator, I had now discovered the true perk of physics –rather than just decrypting the story behind the cosmos for myself, it allowed me to become a part of the narrative; I was becoming a part of the story.  

            </p>
            <p>
                So, what character do I want to play in this story? A physicist is like a magician, I am told. Am I a magician? No, magicians have secrets to tell, but I’m still in search of one. So, who am I? Maybe, I’m Prometheus, playing with the unknown fire of physics, even if it means being punished by an eagle in the form of sleepless nights, when I’m most likely to be found revising tensor calculus, envisioning the design for the next space toilet or pondering about intergalactic travel while penning the sequel to my 374-page science-fiction novel. As time continues to be the antagonist of my story, I find comfort in the fact that physics is also the only subject that can allow me to theoretically reverse the flow of time.  

            </p>
            <p> 
                And till I do find a way to reverse the flow of time, I hope to continue doing what physics allows me to do best – question. Perhaps, questions are why I love physics: it is a subject of possibilities – a beautiful gift to a storyteller. Perhaps, the unknown fire that I as Prometheus am looking for is hidden in the little details around me. Perhaps, if Newton discovered gravity by observing an apple, the secret of the universe lies in my favorite black chair.
